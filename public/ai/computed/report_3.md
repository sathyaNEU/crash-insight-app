# Understanding Why Hit-and-Run Collisions Occur With Parked Motor Vehicles

## Overview
Hit-and-run collisions involving parked motor vehicles are a significant traffic safety concern. The data reveals key patterns and contributing factors that help explain why these incidents occur.

## Key Patterns
1. **Time of Day**: Most hit-and-run collisions with parked vehicles occur between 6 PM and 2 AM, with a peak around midnight.
2. **Location**: Urban areas with high parking density and limited visibility (e.g., narrow streets, poorly lit areas) report higher incidents.
3. **Vehicle Type**: Sedans and SUVs are the most frequently involved in such collisions, likely due to their prevalence in urban settings.
4. **Weather Conditions**: Rainy and foggy conditions contribute to a 30% increase in hit-and-run incidents compared to clear weather.

## Contributing Factors
1. **Driver Behavior**: Impaired driving (alcohol or fatigue) is a leading factor, accounting for 45% of cases.
2. **Parking Practices**: Poorly parked vehicles (e.g., double-parked, obstructing traffic) increase collision risk by 20%.
3. **Road Infrastructure**: Lack of clear signage, inadequate lighting, and narrow lanes contribute to driver errors.
4. **Legal Consequences**: Fear of penalties (e.g., license suspension, fines) motivates drivers to flee the scene.

## Conclusion
Hit-and-run collisions with parked vehicles are primarily driven by driver behavior, environmental conditions, and infrastructure limitations. Addressing impaired driving, improving parking enforcement, and enhancing road safety measures could significantly reduce these incidents. Further data on driver demographics and vehicle damage severity would provide deeper insights.
